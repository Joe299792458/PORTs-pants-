<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>PORTs is an American clothing company that produces pants that can also convert into shorts. The mission of PORTs is to provide affordable clothing apparel that offers multipurpose use. PORTs clothing apparel will cost a competitively $39.99 (without tax included). We look forward to expanding within the retail industry with the possibility of potentially merging with bigger clothing manufacturers such as Levi’s and Columbia. Some companies we would like to vertically merge with in the future are Perfectx zippers and Productcity buttons. These two companies will benefit us by having more control over our supplies. If we were to experience a scarcity of supplies needed for our product we will resort to plastic buttons and Velcro alternatives. Should our marketing be so successful that a product shortage occurs, we would expand our production of PORTs. In case we have a surplus of PORTs we will expand to other country markets. Using this strategy will allow us to expand with our surplus while the price remains intact. The main target consumers we will aim towards are 18-35-year-old males in the lower-middle-income brack.</p>
